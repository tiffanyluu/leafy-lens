# 🌿 **LeafyLens** 🌿

A plant identification web app built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) using TypeScript and JWT-based authentication. Users can identify plants and manage their scan history securely.

## Features

- **Plant Identification**: Upload a plant photo, and the app uses the **Pl@ntNet API** to identify it and display details like the plant’s scientific and common names.
- **Scan History**: Users can view previously identified plants in their scan history.
- **User Accounts**: Users can sign up, log in, and authenticate using **JWT** to manage their scans securely.
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: The app works smoothly across phones, tablets, and desktops for easy navigation and plant identification.

> ℹ️ **Coming Soon**: Personalized care tips (watering, sunlight, etc.) will be re-introduced once the **Trefle API** is back up.
